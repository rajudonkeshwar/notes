Linux follows key based authentication by default

/etc/ssh/sshd_config --> edit the SSH related configuration
/etc/ssh/sshd_config --> any mistakes in this file, we cant ssh into server
systemctl restart sshd
sshd -t --> check config is correct or not

key based authentication --> ramesh should generate his public key and private key...
