Permissions
-----------------
R -> 4
W -> 2
X -> 1

- 		            rw- 					  r-- 			  r-- 	ec2-user ec2-user
file    <owner-who-created>     <group>			<others>

ec2-user --> Owner --> Read and Write
ec2-user --> Group --> Only Read
Others --> Other than and owner and group --> Only read

Who can change permissions of file or folder --> owners or root user

owner/user --> u
group --> g
others --> o

chmod o+w devsecops.txt
chmod o-r suresh.txt

chmod ugo+rwx suresh.txt

chmod 740 suresh.txt
chmod 777 suresh.txt
chmod 755 suresh.txt


admin should ask for suresh public key
root user can create a folder .ssh in /home/suresh
ownership of the folder should be on suresh
chown -R suresh:suresh .ssh
chown <user>:<group> file/folder

inside .ssh we need to create a file called authorized_keys
this file owner should be suresh
permissions can be max 600

ssh -i suresh.pem suresh@IP

/home/suresh --> authorized_keys

Package management
====================
windows laptops are cofigured with URL to pull the updates

usually one package depends on other packages...

yum install <package-name>
dnf install <package-name> --> apt-get is for ubuntu

dnf remove <package-name>

dnf list installed -> already installed inside linux
dnf list available --> all - installed


Service Management
====================
ssh -i <private-key> suresh@IP

request goes to IP, checks SSH is running on port number 22...

systemctl status sshd

http service --> nginx or apache

dnf install nginx -y

start nginx service --> systemctl start nginx

http://IP:80

systemctl stop nginx
systemctl restart nginx --> restart

systemctl enable nginx --> services will start automatically

systemctl start git --> invalid

few packages are just utilities, they are command line packages. Few packages are service related, we can start/stop/restart/enable

Process Management
===================
TL
Senior
Junior
Fresher

TL --> TASK-1 --> Senior
Senior --> TASK-2 --> Junior
Junior --> TASK-3 --> Fresher

for TASK-3 TASK-2 is the parent
for TASK-2 TASK-1 is the parent

Process --> in linux everything is process

echo "Hello World" --> creates one process instance id

gives the result and then mark the process as completed

PPID --> parent process instance id

foreground and background

kill PID --> request to stop
kill -9 PID --> order to stop

Network Management
=====================
netstat -lntp

systemctl status nginx
ps -ef | grep nginx
netstat -lntp --> check port is open or not
